We step through imaginary time and at each time step, we should first measure the expectation values of the pauli matrices $\\sigma$. This is indicated in the first two lines of the for loop. Using the relevant expectation values, we obtain the coefficients $a[m]$ in equation (2.5) of Lecture 12 using the update rule in equation (2.9-2.11).

Well, our earlier functions allow us to measure the expectation values of the different pauli matrices. How do we obtain $S_{ij}$ from a list of $\\bra{\\psi}\\sigma\\ket{\\psi}$?
